After using the system for a while, the sound card appears to be disconnected and no sound can be played. The moment this situation occurs, even restarting the system doesn't help, the card does appear to be present to the system, but attempts to play audio fail. The hardware needs to be removed and added via the built-in troubleshooter, then there is a chance to start the audio player after a reboot. As long as the player is playing music, the audio disconnect situation does not occur.","cover":"/articles/get-started.webp","author":{"name":"Madbeyk von BQ","avatarUrl":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1042510623962275840/1Iw_Mvud_400x400.jpg","link":"https://twitter.com/atinux"},"date":"2024-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","layout":"article","_type":"markdown","_id":"content:articles:1.2024-02-05-soundkeeper.md","_source":"content","_file":"articles/1.2024-02-05-soundkeeper.md","_stem":"articles/1.2024-02-05-soundkeeper","_extension":"md"},{"_path":"/articles/configure","_dir":"articles","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Configure Alpine","description":"Learn how to configure Alpine with the app.config.ts file.","cover":"/articles/configure-alpine.webp","author":{"name":"Cl√©ment Ollivier","avatarUrl":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1370286658432724996/ZMSDzzIi_400x400.jpg","link":"https://twitter.com/clemcodes"},"date":"2022-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","layout":"article","_type":"markdown","_id":"content:articles:2.configure.md","_source":"content","_file":"articles/2.configure.md","_stem":"articles/2.configure","_extension":"md"}]
