# Soundkeeper - first public release

Recently, I have been experiencing problems with my Komplete Audio 6 sound card under my current installation of Windows 11. After using the system for a while, the sound card appears to be disconnected and no sound can be played. The moment this situation occurs, even restarting the system doesn't help, the card does appear to be present to the system, but attempts to play audio fail. The hardware needs to be removed and added via the built-in troubleshooter, then there is a chance to start the audio player after a reboot. As long as the player is playing music, the audio disconnect situation does not occur.

To avoid having to play music when it is not needed, I wrote a small utility (I named it **Soundkeeper**) that keeps the sound card active by repeating the playback of a short sound sample at a volume that is inaudible to the ear. It just works.

#### Info about application

**It prevents loss of playback audio device under MS Windows by repeatedly playing a short audio signal in the background.
Also can be used for testing of audio devices. It has very low CPU and memory usage.**

The app is designed and tested for Windows 11, I assume it will work well on Windows 10 and 7 as well.

There are two editions. The basic one is a console application controlled via command line parameters. The advanced has user control via a GUI through which all aspects of the application can be set up and controlled. The internal logic for working with audio is identical in both editions.

The program utilizes the [Bass audio engine](https://www.un4seen.com/bass.html) for handling audio devices.

#### Features

- possibility to select the sound device to be used 
- silent mode - barely audible sound output to the ears
- automatic start of the output when the application is started and the possibility to launch the application with Windows startup
- automatic save of settings (GUI version only)
- configuration via command line parameters (console version only for now)

#### Download

I make each version available in 64-bit and 32-bit binary versions, so the application will run on 32-bit platforms too.
