# Soundkeeper - first public release

Recently, I have been experiencing problems with my Komplete Audio 6 sound card under my current installation of Windows 11. After using the system for a while, the sound card appears to be disconnected and no sound can be played. The moment this situation occurs, even restarting the system doesn't help, the card does appear to be present to the system, but attempts to play audio fail. The hardware needs to be removed and added via the built-in troubleshooter, then there is a chance to start the audio player after a reboot. As long as the player is playing music, the audio disconnect situation does not occur.

I wrote a small utility (named **Soundkeeper**) that keeps the sound card active by repeating the playback of a short sound sample at a volume that is inaudible to the ear. It just works and it's free.

#### Info about application

**Application prevents loss of playback audio device under MS Windows by repeatedly playing a short audio signal.
Also can be used for testing of audio devices. It has very low CPU usage and memory footprint.**

It's written for MS Windows 11, perhaps it will work on Windows 10 and 7.

There are two editions. **Console program** controlled via command line parameters and a **GUI application**. The internal audio logic is identical in both editions.

The program utilizes the [Bass audio engine](https://www.un4seen.com/bass.html) for handling audio devices.

#### Features

- select the audio device to be used (it selects default device by default)
- silent mode - generates barely audible sound output to the ears
- minimalize to system tray (GUI version only)
- automatic start of the output when the application is started
- possibility to launch the application with Windows startup (user logon)
- automatic save of settings (GUI version only)
- configuration via command line parameters (console version only for now)
